MIND
====
> Bring your thoughts into reality in and overpower opponents. MIND challenges the greatest imaginations from every corner of the globe to compete in a battle of concentration and discipline.

MIND is a card game where participating **Thinkers** battle it out using powerful **Thought** and **Intellect** cards.

# The Goal
You win a MIND game by **breaking all 3 Focus counters of the opposing Thinker**. There are two ways you can break your opponent's Focus counters:

1. Challenging a Thinker directly with your Thought cards
2. Forcing a Thinker to run out of cards

Thinkers **alternate turns** until there is only one left standing. 

#Steps of a Turn
Your turn is divided up into three steps **Recover**, **Play**, and **Challenge**.

##Recover Step
1. **Discard** any number of cards in your hand
2. **Draw** until you have a maximum of 5 cards in your hand
3. **Disengage** all of your Engaged Thoughts in play

##Play Step
There are a three actions you may perform on the play step:
* **Play Thoughts** from your hand
* **Remove cards** you have in play that you no longer need 
* **Group or Ungroup** your Thoughts to make them stronger

##Challenge Step
During your Challenge Step you can Engage your Thoughts to declare a Challenge. You may:
* **Challenge other Groups or Thoughts** your opponent has in play to remove them from play
* **Challenge your opponent directly** to try and break a Focus counter

Let's take a look at how to set up a game and then we'll discuss the Turns in detail

#Starting a game
To begin you’ll need two players, each with a deck of **20 unique cards** and a single Thinker Card. Each card in your deck must be unique in some way and having multiple copies of the same effect per deck is not allowed.

1. Place your Thinker Card in front of you
2. Shuffle your deck
3. Decide who will go first
4. Draw 5 cards

That's all, you're now ready to begin.
