MIND
====
> Bring your thoughts into reality and overpower opponents. MIND challenges the greatest imaginations from every corner of the globe to compete in a battle of concentration and discipline.

MIND is a card game where participating **Thinkers** battle it out using powerful **Thought** and **Intellect** cards.

# The Goal
You win a MIND game by **breaking all 3 Focus counters of the opposing Thinker**. There are two ways you can break your opponent's Focus counters:

1. Challenging a Thinker directly with your Thought cards
2. Forcing a Thinker to run out of cards

Thinkers **alternate turns** until there is only one left standing. 

# Steps of a Turn
Your turn is divided up into three steps **Recover**, **Play**, and **Challenge**.

## Recover Step
1. **Discard** any number of cards in your hand
2. **Draw** until you have a maximum of 5 cards in your hand
3. **Disengage** all of your Engaged Thoughts in play

## Play Step
There are a three actions you may perform on the play step:
1. **Remove cards** you have in play that you no longer need 
2. **Play Thoughts** from your hand
3. **Group or Ungroup** your Thoughts to make them stronger

## Challenge Step
During your Challenge Step you can Engage your Thoughts to declare a Challenge. You may:
* **Challenge other Groups or Thoughts** your opponent has in play to remove them from play
* **Challenge your opponent directly** to try and break a Focus counter

Let's take a look at how to set up a game.

# Starting a game
To begin you’ll need two players, each with a deck of **20 unique cards** and a single Thinker Card. Each card in your deck must be unique in some way and having multiple copies of the same effect per deck is not allowed.

1. Place your Thinker Card in front of you
2. Shuffle your deck
3. Decide who will go first
4. Draw 5 cards

That's all, you're now ready to begin.

# Card types
There are three types of cards, each played differently throughout a game.

## Thinker
Thinker cards are played at the beginning of the each game. They display the player’s Breaking Point, Memory, and Effect.
* **Break:** how powerful a direct challenge must be in order to break a Focus counter
* **Memory:**  limit of cards you can have out in play at once
* **Effect:** special rules for this Thinker

## Thoughts 
Thoughts are mental objects that stay on the field and help you overcome your opponent; it is a card that can only be played on your turn.
* **Cost:** amount of Memory required to play and keep this card in play
* **Power:** base potency of a Thought
* **Effect:** special rules for the Thought

## Intellects 
Intellects are mental abilities that can be played at any time during any turn in response to any action. 
* **Cost:** amount of Memory required to play or keep this card in play
* **Effect:** special effect granted when the card is played

# On your first turn
During your recovery step you **may discard any number of card you initially drew** during the game setup and draw until you have 5 cards.

The first player to take the first turn also skips the Challenge step.

# Running out of cards to draw
Careful when discarding cards! If you do not have enough cards left to draw on your Recover step, destroy one of your Focus counters, and reshuffle your discard pile back into your deck.

# Playing Thoughts
As long as you don't exceed your Memory, you may play any number of Thoughts from your hand on to the play area. While a card is in play, its Cost is deducted from your total available Memory.

Thoughts can only be played from your hand during the Play step of your turn. The only exception to this is when a card Effect says otherwise.

## Thinker Overload
Sometimes a card effect will cause you to have more cards in play than you can afford. When this happens, immediately remove cards until the total Cost of all of your cards in play does not exceed your Memory.

## Grouping Thoughts
During your Play Step, you may group, ungroup, or regroup your Disengaged Thoughts in play.

Grouping allows your Thoughts to challenge as a single unit with a combined Power. Grouped Thoughts are considered a single target.

# Declaring a Challenge
You can declare challenges to either:
* Remove your opponent's Thoughts in play
* Destroy your opponent's Focus counters

To declare a challenge you’ll need a *Disengaged* Thought or Group. A challenge is made up of three steps:
1. ***Engage* your Thought or Group** by turning the card on its side
2. **Declare a target** that can be an opposing Thought, Group, or Thinker
3. **Resolve the challenge** by figuring out who won the challenge

## Resolving a challenge
Figuring out who won a challenge is slightly different depending on your target.

**When challenging another Thought or Group:**
* The Thought or Group with the highest total Power wins
* The loser is removed and sent to the discard pile
* In the case of a draw, both are removed and sent to the discard pile

**When challenging a Thinker directly:**
* If the total Power of your challenge is higher than the Break point, destroy 1 Focus counter
* If it is lower, or equal, nothing happens

## Blocking a Challenge
After the target for a challenge has been declared, you may choose to block with a *Disengaged* Thought or Group . To declare a Block, *Engage* a Thought or Group. the challenge is redirected to the blocker.

## Miss
When the target of a challenge is removed the challenge misses. When a challenge misses its outcome is negated and the challenger(s) remain Engaged.

# Playing Intellects
Intellects can be played at any time during any turn. The intellect last played gets resolved first. Intellects stay in play until their effect is resolved.

## Intellect Scope
The intellect’s effect will define how long the card stays in play, this is called Scope.
* **Continuous:** Ongoing until the card is removed
* **Temporary:** Until the end of this turn or until the card is removed
* **Immediate:** Resolved right away and then removed from play

[Examples of the three Scope types]
 
# Victory
That’s it! Alternate turns until a single player remains with Focus counters.
