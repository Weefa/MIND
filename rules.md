# The goal
MIND is played between two players, each with a deck of cards containing Thoughts and Intellects. 
The goal of MIND is to force your opponents past their Breaking Point three times by either challenging them directly with powerful Thoughts or depleting their deck.

#Starting a game
To begin you’ll need two players, each with a deck of 20 unique cards and a single Thinker Card. Each card in your deck must be unique in some way and having multiple copies of the same effect per deck is not allowed.

1. Place your Thinker Card in front of you
2. Shuffle your deck and offer your opponent the opportunity to cut your deck
3. Decide who will go first at random
4. Draw 5 cards

That's all, you're now ready to begin.

#Card types
There are three types of cards, each played differently throughout a game.

##Thinker
Thinker cards are played at the beginning of the each game. They display the player's Breaking Point, Memory, and Effect.
* **Breaking Point:** how powerful a direct challenge must be in order to break you
* **Memory:**  limit of cards you can have in play at once
* **Effect:** a beneficial effect that gives you an advantage 

##Thoughts 
Thoughts are mental objects that stay on the field and help you overcome your opponent; it is a Unit that can only be played on your turn.
* **Cost:** amount of Memory required to play and keep this card in play
* **Power:** base potency of a Thought
* **Effect:** special rules for the Thought

##Intellects 
Intellects are mental abilities that can be played at any time during any turn. The intellect last played gets resolved first. 
* **Cost:** amount of Memory required to play or keep this card in play
* **Effect:** special ability granted when the card is played

###Intellect Scope
The intellect’s effect will define how long the card stays in play, this is the Intellect Scope.
* **Continuous:** Ongoing until the card is removed
* **Temporary:** Until the end of this turn or until the card is removed
* **Immediate:** Resolved right away and then removed from play

#On your turn
Your turn is divided up into three steps: Recover, Play, and Challenge.

##Recover
1. Discard any number of card in your hand
2. Draw until you have a maximum of 5 cards in your hand
3. Disengage all of your Engaged Thoughts in play
That's it, now it's time for your Play step.

###Running out of cards
If you do not have enough cards left to draw, reshuffle your discard pile into your deck. This counts as being forced past your Breaking Point.

##Play
There are a three actions you may perform on the play step:
* **Play a Thought:** you may play any number of Thoughts from your hand, as long as you don't exceed your Memory
* **Remove cards:** you may remove any number of your own cards in play
* **Group Thoughts:** You may group, ungroup, or regroup your Disengaged Thoughts in play.

###Grouping
Grouping allows your Thoughts to challenge as a single unit with a combined Power. Grouped Thoughts are considered a single target. 

##Challenge
You can declare challenges to either:
* Remove your opponent's Thoughts in play
* Break your opponent

###Declaring a challenge
To declare a challenge you’ll need a Disengaged Group or Thought. A challenge is made up of three steps:
1. Engage your Thought or Group. This is done by turning the card on its side
2. Declare a target. You may target an opposing Thought, Group, or Player
3. Resolve the challenge by figuring out who won

####Can’t challenge  on the first turn of the game
The challenge step is skipped on the first player’s first turn.

###Resolving a challenge
Figuring out who won a challenge is slightly different depending on your target.

####When challenging another Thought or Group
The Thought or Group with the highest total Power wins. The loser is removed and sent to the discard pile. In the case of a draw, both are removed and sent to the discard pile

####When challenging a Thinker directly
You can force your opponent past their Breaking Point if the total power of your Thought or Group is higher than the target player's Breaking Point. The Loser is not removed. 
Breaking your opponent

##End of your turn
Once you're done with the challenge step your turn ends. It's now your opponents turn.

#On your opponent’s turn
On your opponent's turn you may choose to Block challenges with a Disengaged Thought or Group.

##Blocking
When a target for a challenge has been declared, your may choose to block with a Disengaged Thought or Group . To Block you may Engage a Thought or Group so that the challenge is redirected to the blocker.
That’s it! Alternate turns until a single player remains unbroken.

#Victory
Your opponent's Breaking Point is reached when you’ve challenged directly with a total power higher than their breaking point, or when your opponent runs out of cards to draw and is forced to reshuffle.

When you’ve broken your opponent three times, you win!

##Additional Notes
###Interception
An Interception is caused when a card effect changes variables in play so that an effect previously activated cannot be completed. When an effect is intercepted it’s outcome is negated.

###Thinker Overload
Overloading a Thinker happens when the total Cost of the cards the Thinker has in play exceeds his Memory. At this point, the Thinker must remove cards in play until the Cost is satisfied.

###Miss
When the target of a challenge is removed the challenge misses. When a challenge misses it’s outcome is negated and the challenger(s) remain Engaged.
